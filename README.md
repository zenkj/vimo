Mobile Version VI Editor

##Motivation
The vi editor is created when the input situation is very difficult.
Now for the desktop pc or laptop pc, the input situation is much better.

But for the mobile device, the input situation is still difficult:

* Mobile device is very small, so the physical/virtual keyboard is small too.
* Many keys miss because of the small size, especially the direction keys.
* Punctuations are difficult to input.

I want to edit code at any time, so vi's compact key usage is suitable.
But the traditional vi is not suitable for mobile device.

##Implementation
I feel guys who want to edit code at any time like to use android devices,
instead of Apple device. So the first version is for android.
